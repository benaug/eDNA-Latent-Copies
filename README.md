# eDNA-Latent-Copies
Models for an eDNA release experiment that treat copy number as latent count variables


Basic files to simulate from and fit models that regard the number of copies in each PCR rep as Poisson random variables.
Minimal info for now, see files for the abstract and model diagrams.
