# eDNA-Latent-Copies
Models for an eDNA release experiment that treat copy number as latent count variables


Basic files to simulate from and fit models that regard the number of copies in each PCR rep as Poisson random variables.
Minimal info for now, see files for the abstract and model diagrams.

Inhibitor models may take a long time to converge, or not converge at all if the data is not sufficient for the model (leaving this vague for now).
